# Mostly_Enigma_Cplusplus

I'm redoing my old python enigma machine in C++.

Unfortunetly I was an idiot and forgot to comment the logic behind my old enigma machine so I'm probably going to end up going back and untangling that before I move any further with this particular project.

My python enigma machine can be found here: https://github.com/ldmcdona/Mostly_Enigma

Still shaking some of the rust off my C++ skills so expect some jank.
