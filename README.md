# Mostly_Enigma_Cplusplus

I'm redoing my old python enigma machine in C++.

The current version 'works' but only with expected input. I still have to finish a few quality of life things and some testing.

My python enigma machine can be found here: https://github.com/ldmcdona/Mostly_Enigma

Still shaking some of the rust off my C++ skills so expect some jank.
